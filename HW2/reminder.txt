A friendly reminder:

Every year we have students that accidentally do something wrong
with their submissions, after spending many hours doing the
homework.  Please read these reminders and observe them
carefully.

Please check after submitting that you have submitted the
correct files.  Incorrect submissions will not be given any
leniency.

Please check that you have correctly initialed the appropriate
independent work statement.  Failure to observe the class honor
code will be prosecuted.
